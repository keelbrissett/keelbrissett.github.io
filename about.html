        This course has deepened my appreciation for how thoughtfully designed technology can shape not only user experience, but also behavior, accessibility, and community.
        In CSCI 376, we don’t just learn how to build interfaces — we learn how to design with purpose. Through hands-on design sprints, prototyping tools like Figma, and collaborative critiques, 
        I’ve gained experience applying human-centered design processes to real-world problems. I’ve learned to back design decisions with research, iterate based on feedback, and clearly communicate 
        the "why" behind my choices. This class has challenged me to think critically about the systems I create. Are they usable? Are they equitable? Are they thoughtful? These questions guide 
        the work you'll see throughout my portfolio. If you’re curious to see how I’ve grown as a designer this semester, explore the design sprints below — each one reflects a different step in my 
        journey toward building better, more human technology.
